KNN and Neural Networks for Classification: A classification task on letter recognition data using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network models. 
Data is standardized, models are trained and tested, and performance is evaluated with accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports. 
Key Skills: Classification, KNN, Neural Networks, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation.
